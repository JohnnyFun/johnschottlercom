# Tech

- to deploy, push to master and netlify will build and deploy it
  - login to netlify to see build status
- static website, no server side code anymore
- svelte so nice
- favicon made with http://www.faviconer.com/
- hosted on netlify with ssl now, so can do VR games and WebRTC
  - netlify configured to always serve index.html so client routing works

# Todo

- move dirtball and vr shooting game (with their readmes) into johnschottlercom
  - then delete those 2 repos on github...
