# Running locally

- `npm i`
- `npm start`

# Tech

- static website, no server side code anymore
- svelte so nice
- favicon made with http://www.faviconer.com/
- hosted on netflify with ssl now, so can do VR games and WebRTC
  - netlify configured to always serve index.html so client routing works

# TODO:

- improve Code.svelte 
  - pull pull content from a js file so I get syntax highlighting and can actually run it to make sure it works.
  - put global-css into the control and hook up preprocessor `global` instead of linking to the stylesheet from index.html awkwardly.
