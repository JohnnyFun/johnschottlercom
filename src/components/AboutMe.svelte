      Hi, I've been a full-stack web developer since 2010. I also dabble in creating video games and machine learning models.
      Checkout my <a href="/resume">résumé</a> and <a href="/projects">hobby projects</a> for more about that.

      In my personal time, I enjoy a variety of things. Currently, I'm primarily focused on learning jiu jitsu and spanish.
      I'm a blue belt in jiu jitsu and compete a few times per year for fun.
      I have a B1 level in spanish, and my goal is to achieve at least B2.
