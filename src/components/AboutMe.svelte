      Hi, I've been a full-stack web developer since 2010. I also dabble in creating video games and machine learning models. Checkout my <a href="/resume">résumé</a> and <a href="/projects">hobby projects</a> for more about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my personal time, I enjoy a variety of things. Currently, I'm primarily focused on learning jiu jitsu and spanish. I'm a blue belt in jiu jitsu and compete a few times per year for fun. I have a B1 level in spanish, and my goal is to achieve at least B2.
